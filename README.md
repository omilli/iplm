## LLM Sharding

### Model Sharding

`@mlc-ai/web-llm` compatible models are sharded across the iplm network which is powered by `pouchdb`. Support for partial and parallel model installs comes out of the box. Models are installed directly from peers.

### Prompt Sharding

Large prompts, or prompts that cover multiple subjects, are sharded into multiple prompts, which are run in parallel via web workers.
